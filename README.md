### 🔥 Special Rule: The "Sudden Death" Round

Sudden Death is a multi-phase tie-breaker with specific win conditions.

#### Activation

Sudden Death activates if **two or more players** have a score of **9 or more points** at the same time. Once activated, the normal win condition is paused, and players must win according to one of the following phases:

#### Phase 1: Win by a 2-Point Lead (Scores 9-11)

During this phase, a player can only win if their score is at least **2 points higher** than the next-highest player currently in Sudden Death.

**Crucially, this rule only applies if the winning score is `11` or less.** A player cannot win by reaching `12` while another is at `10`.

> **Example 1 (Win):** Player A has `11` points and Player B has `9` points. The lead is 2 points, so **Player A wins**.
>
> **Example 2 (No Win):** Player A has `11` points and Player B has `10` points. The lead is only 1 point, so the game continues.
>
> **Example 3 (No Win):** Player A has `12` points and Player B has `10` points. Even though the lead is 2 points, Player A cannot win this way. The game continues into Phase 2.

#### Phase 2: The Final Round (Scores 12+)

This phase begins when **all players** still in Sudden Death have a score of **12 or more**.

-   The "win by 2" rule is now **disabled**.
-   The game becomes a simple race: the first player to reach **14 points wins immediately.**

> **Example:** Player A and Player B are both at `13` points. Player A answers correctly and reaches `14`. **Player A wins instantly**, even though the lead is only 1 point.
